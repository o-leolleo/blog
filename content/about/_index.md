# Me 👨‍💻

Hey I'm Leonardo Cavalcante do Prado, a DevOps Engineer. I'm creating this blog as a way to build my own place on the web, where I can share ideas, thoughts and curiosities. I'll try to keep on this page a snapshot of my current endeavors (Technologies, Hobbies, etc.), more of a second brain if I may.

### Technologies ⚙️
- Linux
- Terraform
- Kubernetes
- Docker
- AWS
- Ansible
- GitLab (especially their CI/CD)
- Python
- Bash
