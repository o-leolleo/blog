# Me 👨‍💻

Hey I'm Leonardo Cavalcante do Prado, a Brazilian DevOps Engineer hailing from the Northeast region of the country.

My passion for creative works dates back to my early years, and I initially expressed it through drawing. I even have some of my artwork posted online, which I might share here in the future. Later, I graduated in Computer Engineering from the Universidade Federal do Vale do São Francisco (UNIVASF). Although I lean towards the arts, I've always had a keen interest in [STEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science,_technology,_engineering,_and_mathematics) subjects as well. I find the creative ways in which abstraction is used to solve complex problems and make sense of the unknown fascinating.

Programming, problem-solving, GNU Linux, web development, DevOps, automation, and Agile are all areas that have captured my attention over the years. I've been encouraged by colleagues, blog posts, and especially my wife to share my knowledge and experiences, which is one of the reasons why I created this blog. Writing also helps me stay up-to-date and fuels my curiosity and eagerness to learn.

I hope you enjoy reading my blog as much as I enjoy writing it 😁.
