On this post I discuss this blog tech stack and my decisions behind it. It's my very first content for a long while, hope you find it useful.

Life and career have changed a lot since my last [footprint](https://medium.com/sysvale/iac-infraestrutura-como-c%C3%B3digo-c514a869b88d) on the web three years ago, I've now fully transitioned into the DevOps world and working with CI/CD, IaC, automation and tons of YAML on a daily basis. However tech world is constantly moving and I felt I needed a way to keep myself learning and up to date, that's why this blog has been created but also one of the reasons for choosing each of the technologies discussed in the following sections.

## Hugo

Besides its popularity and speed, Hugo uses Go and its templates. I have working experience with Helm which uses the same stack, this enabled me to interchange skills and by using Hugo I would get better at Helm and vice-versa. Also, finding community content around it was very easy and made the whole process a breeze.

Some would list Go templates as driving the decision not to use Hugo, interestingly enough this brought me to it. However I have to agree that it's not as intuitive as other template engines like jinja2.

## Tailwind

## Cloudflare Pages

## GitHub Actions
