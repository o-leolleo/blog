Wiping, cleaning up your AWS account, sounds a very dangerous, destructive action, and it indeed is. Specially when one tell you this can be performed automatically and on a schedule. Problems arise even if you don't touch your infrastructure, so why would one destroy it from time to time and on purpose?

<!--more-->

## Why?

Well, there are some valid use cases for such tooling. **Hopefully none of these on live, production, user facing environments**. For example:
- You have a personal, development, cloud account and you don't want to get an expensive cloud bill from AWS when you just want to test things out
- You run tests for IaC which requires you to create resources and destroy them, often times leaving dangling resources behind
- You have a team where each member has its own AWS account where they can do --- virtually --- anything, but like on the first use case, you don't want an expensive bill when people are just developing and testing things out!

In such scenarios those accounts only host resources which are not intended to be used by the public. Whether this public are application users, developers, or anyone aside the person who create those resources and potentially her/his peers to whom she/he is showcasing things to. Also these very resources are better off being temporary, as they have a very short life-span: you create resources, confirm they work as you expect, then destroy them --- but often times you forget it.

These use-cases are addressed by [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke). It destroys all your AWS resources on the specified accounts. _I discovered it when looking for something similar after forgetting an EKS cluster running for a week on my personal AWS account_ ðŸ˜…, which didn't cost me more than $50.00 as far as I remember but it's useful to save money when possible and to avoid unnecessary costs, specially when next time I might not be so lucky.

AWS Nuke can be run on number of ways. One of those is to run it on a CI pipeline. This is the approach I choose and discuss on the next sections. I implemented it using GitLab CI for daily destroying all of my personal AWS account resources.

## Configuring aws-nuke

The following snippet shows my configuration (`nuke-config.yml`) --- Account ID and user name omitted.

```yaml
# nuke-config.yml
regions:
- eu-north-1
- ap-south-1
- eu-west-3
- eu-west-2
- eu-west-1
- ap-northeast-3
- ap-northeast-2
- ap-northeast-1
- sa-east-1
- ca-central-1
- ap-southeast-1
- ap-southeast-2
- eu-central-1
- us-east-1
- us-east-2
- us-west-1
- us-west-2
- global

resource-types:
  excludes:
  - EC2DefaultSecurityGroupRule

accounts:
  "<my-account-id>":
    filters:
      IAMUser:
      - "<my-user-name>"
      IAMUserPolicyAttachment:
      - "<my-user-name> -> AdministratorAccess"
      IAMVirtualMFADevice:
      - "arn:aws:iam::<my-account-id>:mfa/<my-user-name>"
      IAMUserGroupAttachment:
      - "<my-user-name> -> Admin"
      IAMLoginProfile:
      - "<my-user-name>"
      IAMGroup:
      - "Admin"
      IAMGroupPolicyAttachment:
      - "Admin -> AdministratorAccess"
      IAMUserAccessKey:
      - "<my-user-name> -> {{AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}"
      EC2KeyPair:
      - "<key-pair-name-to-keep>"
      EC2Subnet:
      - property: DefaultVPC
        value: "true"
      EC2DHCPOption:
      - property: DefaultVPC
        value: "true"
      EC2InternetGateway:
      - property: DefaultVPC
        value: "true"
      EC2RouteTable:
      - property: DefaultVPC
        value: "true"
      EC2InternetGatewayAttachment:
      - property: DefaultVPC
        value: "true"
      EC2VPC:
      - property: IsDefault
        value: "true"
      CloudWatchDashboard:
      - "Main"

```

Let's dig a bit into it:
- First, I declare all the regions I want to wipe out. In my case these are all the AWS `regions` plus global --- for global resources like IAM users.
- Second, I exclude from the destroy all AWS default security groups with `resource-types.excludes`.
- Third, I define all resources I don't want to destroy on my account inside the `accounts` property. Basically these are the bare minimum I need in order to perform anything useful in it like logging in, keep being an admin, my access keys, ec2 ssh keys, etc.

I replace `{{AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}` by the access key used by the CI pipeline to perform the AWS actions --- otherwise I'd be able to run it only once ðŸ¤·.

## Running aws-nuke

With the `nuke-config.yml` file in place, I can run the commands explained on the snippet below. Whilst here I pass the access key id and secret explicitly, there are other options explained on the [tool docs](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke#aws-credentials).

```bash
# dry run
aws-nuke \
  --access-key-id "<my-access-key-id>" \
  --secret-access-key "<my-secret-access-key>" \
  --config nuke-config.yml

# perform the destroy actions, but first ask for confirmation
aws-nuke \
  --access-key-id "<my-access-key-id>" \
  --secret-access-key "<my-secret-access-key>" \
  --no-dry-run \
  --config \
  nuke-config.yml

# perform the destroy actions without first asking for confirmation
aws-nuke \
  --access-key-id "<my-access-key-id>" \
  --secret-access-key "<my-secret-access-key>" \
  --no-dry-run \
  --force \
  --config \
  nuke-config.yml
```

The final step is to wrap these things up and make them run on a schedule, in this case a [Gitlab CI schedule pipeline](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/schedules.html).

## The scheduled pipeline

First of all we need a `gitlab-ci.yml` file. It's detailed below, with comments to explain what each block does.

```yaml
# Declares the pipeline stages
stages:
  - dry-run
  - nuke

# Declares the default image used on the pipeline jobs
# also overrides the image's entrypoint,
# so as not to conflict with GitLab default behavior
image:
  name: quay.io/rebuy/aws-nuke:v2.17.0
  entrypoint: [""]

# Here we define a job template which will run aws-nuke
# in either dry-run or real run depending on the NO_DRY_RUN envvar value.
# Pay attention to the replacement performed at the beginning, it replaces
# the {{AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}} by the value of the access key used by the pipeline
# to destroy the resources.
.nuke-run:
  script:
    - sed -i "s/{{AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}/${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}/g" nuke-config.yml
    - |
      aws-nuke \
        --force \
        --access-key-id "${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}" \
        --secret-access-key "${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}" \
        ${NO_DRY_RUN:+--no-dry-run} \
        --config nuke-config.yml

# The dry-run job
# it always run - useful for ensuring MRs and commits are correct -
# and is always "interruptible" (see https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/#interruptible)
dry-run:
  stage: dry-run
  extends: .nuke-run
  interruptible: true

# Runs the aws nuke command
# Only runs on schedules that run against the default branch
nuke:
  stage: nuke
  extends: .nuke-run
  variables:
    NO_DRY_RUN: "yes"
  rules:
    - if: >
        $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == 'schedule'
        && $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```
